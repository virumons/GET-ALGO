            <h3 >Algorithm</h3>
            <p><span id="al">ALGORITHM</span> is a procedure for solving a mathematical problem 
                (as of finding the greatest common divisor) in a finite number of steps that 
                frequently involves repetition of an operation; broadly : a step-by-step procedure 
                for solving a problem or accomplishing some end.
                <br>It can be understood by taking an example of cooking a new recipe. 
                To cook a new recipe, one reads the instructions and steps and execute them one by one, in the given sequence. 
                The result thus obtained is the new dish cooked perfectly. Similarly, algorithms help to do a task in programming to get the expected output.
                The Algorithm designed are language-independent, i.e. they are just plain instructions that can be implemented in any language,
                and yet the output will be the same, as expected.

            <h3>Characteristics of Algorithm</h3>
            <img src="character.png">
            <p>As one would not follow any written instructions to cook the recipe, but only the standard one. Similarly, not all written instructions for programming
                is an algorithm. In order for some instructions to be an algorithm, it must have the following characteristics:<br><br>
                <span id="al"> Clear and Unambiguous:</span><br>
                Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps should be clear in all aspects and must lead to only one meaning.<br>
                <span id="al"> Well-Defined Inputs:</span><br> 
                If an algorithm says to take inputs, it should be well-defined inputs.<br>
                <span id="al"> Well-Defined Outputs:</span><br> 
                The algorithm must clearly define what output will be yielded and it should be well-defined as well.<br>
                <span id="al"> Finite-ness: </span> <br>
                The algorithm must be finite, i.e. it should not end up in an infinite loops or similar.<br>
                <span id="al"> Feasible:</span><br> 
                The algorithm must be simple, generic and practical, such that it can be executed upon with the available resources. It must not contain some future technology, 
                or anything.<br>
                <span id="al">Language Independent:</span><br> 
                The Algorithm designed must be language-independent, i.e. it must be just plain instructions that can be implemented in any language, and yet the output will
                be same, as expected.<br>

                <b>Time Factor:</b><br> 
                Time is measured by counting the number of key operations such as comparisons in the sorting algorithm.<br>
                Time Complexity: Time complexity of an algorithm refers to the amount of time that this algorithm requires to execute and get the result. 
                This can be for normal operations, conditional if-else statements, loop statements, etc.<br>
                <b>How to calculate Time Complexity?</b><br>
                The time complexity of an algorithm is also calculated by determining following 2 components: 
                Constant time part: Any instruction that is executed just once comes in this part. For example, input, output, if-else, switch, etc.
                Variable Time Part: Any instruction that is executed more than once, say n times, comes in this part. For example, loops, recursion, etc.<br><br>
                
                <b>Space Factor:</b><br> 
                Space is measured by counting the maximum memory space required by the algorithm.<br>
                Space Complexity: Space complexity of an algorithm refers to the amount of memory that this algorithm requires to execute and get the result.
                This can be for inputs, temporary operations, or outputs.<br>
                <b>How to calculate Space Complexity?</b><br>
                The space complexity of an algorithm is calculated by determining following 2 components: 
                Fixed Part: This refers to the space that is definitely required by the algorithm. For example,
                input variables, output variables, program size, etc.
                Variable Part: This refers to the space that can be different based on the implementation of the algorithm. 
                For example, temporary variables, dynamic memory allocation, recursion stack space, etc.
